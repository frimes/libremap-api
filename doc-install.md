# Set up your own LibreMap server

## Requirements
You need the following:
* CouchDB server 1.3 (or newer) with the [GeoCouch](https://github.com/couchbase/geocouch/) plugin.
* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (>= 0.8.0) and its great package manager `npm`.
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - can be installed by running: ```npm install -g grunt-cli```

## Installation
1. Clone the repo: ```git clone git@github.com:libremap/libremap-api.git``` and change to the repo dir: ```cd libremap-api```.
2. Download dependencies: ```npm install```.
3. Copy `couch.json.example` to `couch.json` and configure your CouchDB server there.
4. Push the CouchDB design document to your server (for example the `dev` target in `config.json`) by running ```grunt push --couch dev```.
