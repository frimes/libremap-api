# LibreMap

LibreMap is a **scalable**, **global** and **decentralized** router database and map visualization for community networks, such as guifi, Altermundi, FunkFeuer, ninux, freifunk, Commotion... It emerged around the [is4cwn](http://2013.wirelesssummit.org/) by merging the maps of [AlterMap](https://colectivo.altermundi.net/projects/altermap) (Altermundi) and [OpenWiFiMap](https://github.com/freifunk/openwifimap-html5) (freifunk).

LibreMap consists of 2 main parts:
* **[libremap-webui](https://github.com/libremap/libremap-webui):** the HTML5 web app, see [libremap.net](http://libremap.net).
* **libremap-api (this repo!):** the CouchDB server design document that exposes the *LibreMap API*.

## Goals of LibreMap:
* show the state of all community networks, both on a global and local scale.
* decentralized.
* easy to use and extend.
* independent of involved routing protocols and other technical details.
* scale up to global level (>100k routers).
* share open data for community networks.

There's a presentation ([slides](http://libre-mesh.github.io/libremap-talk-2013-is4cwn/)) from the [is4cwn](http://2013.wirelesssummit.org/) that explains the concept and some details.

## Under the hood
* Built with [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) and [GeoCouch](https://github.com/couchbase/geocouch/).
* HTTP REST API.
* Decentralized/federated with CouchDB's built-in replication.
* Each community can set up its own LibreMap instance (see the [install docs](doc-install.md)) and let it replicate to/from existing instances (see the list of [LibreMap instances](libremap-instances.json)). The replication may look like this:
